      "message": "This should be initialized to NaN, not zero. We need to be properly warned about uninitialized data. By adding a literal initializer here, the compiler warning is defeated, so we will no longer be able to know about warnings at compile time.\n\nIf ReadReturn is ever used before it is populated, then we still need to know about this error condition. Initializing it here with a value of NaN will allow us to see this error at runtime, which is a fair compromise.",

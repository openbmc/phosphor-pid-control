      "message": "I\u0027m naming this feature \"core logging\" because there\u0027s already another layer of logging that can be enabled in this program, one that works at a higher level, and I needed to distinguish it. The PidCore name makes sense when it\u0027s part of the \"core logging\" feature. Given this, any suggestions? Calling it \"dump\" or \"data\" or \"context\" seems generic, and wouldn\u0027t provide any advantage.",

      "message": "Part of the reason for the \"core logging\" feature is to debug the guts of this function, the most important function (and the most mysterious) in the entire program. I want to take a snapshot of each variable as it gets modified, even during intermediate steps. That\u0027s why the same variable is copied at many different times. Then, I can see a before-and-after of every change that happens. All of the fields in the \"coreLog\" structure are eventually used, as they are written to the file, for later human perusal.",

      "message": "No, it loads one configuration onto D-Bus with a version number included. When we doing thermal calibration, we would have multiple versions of configuaration for testing. It is easy to know what version currently testing if we have a version number on D-Bus. It is also helpful to know what version currently running after BMC firmware update.",

      "message": "Hmm. Wouldn\u0027t you be able to see what version is running by looking at the current configuration, that is, the D-Bus `Inventory` objects in `entity-manager`? Those would tell you exactly what parameters are in use, more so than simply looking at a version number field. Or, is there a desire to support the old `config.json` file-based configuration as well?\n\nI still don\u0027t really understand what the benefit would be of adding a version number here, or what `phosphor-pid-control` is intended to do with the version number. Is it something only used by the external tools you mentioned?\n\nThere are already two different code paths for providing configuration information to `phosphor-pid-control`, and I am really hesitant to add a third.",

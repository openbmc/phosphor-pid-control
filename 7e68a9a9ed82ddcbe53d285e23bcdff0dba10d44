Or, is there a desire to support the old `config.json` file-based configuration as well?\n\nI still don\u0027t really understand what the benefit would be of adding a version number here, or what `phosphor-pid-control` is intended to do with the version number. Is it something only used by the external tools you mentioned?\n\nThere are already two different code paths for providing configuration information to `phosphor-pid-control`, and I am really hesitant to add a third.",

Have multiple PID control settings on the system, and be able to change between these somehow, perhaps externally (via other changes to external-facing services such as `bmcweb`).\n\nFor example, one could have three versions of settings, \"quiet\", \"normal\", and \"turbo\", and expose an interface to let the user choose one of these three choices. Each of these three versions would activate a different set of pre-tuned thermal parameters appropriate for the platform.\n\nFor safety, the user would not be allowed to change any of the underlying PID loop coefficients or parameters. However, the user would be freely allowed to swap between these three versions at will. This would provide the best balance between safety and flexibility.",

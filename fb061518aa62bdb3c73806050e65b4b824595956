      "message": "Some questions about this part:\nIt seems \"TempToMargin\" vector size has to smaller than \"Inputs\" size. Is it true?\nIf so, I think there may have some problems. For example:\nIf \"Inputs\" likes \u003d\u003e\n```\n            \"Inputs\": [\n                \"DIMM[0-9]\",\n                \"DIMM1[0-5]\"\n            ],\n```\nAnd dbus-sensors only creates some dimms that exist on MB.\nSo pid-control initial logs may like \u003d\u003e\n```\nApr 09 14:11:09 bmc swampd[29035]: PID name: DIMM_CPU0_PID\nApr 09 14:11:09 bmc swampd[29035]: inputs: DIMM11,\n```\n\nHow to set the \"TempToMargin\" in json? Because we may not know the number of the input sensor until runtime.",

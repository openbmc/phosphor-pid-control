# Sensor Config
This program is only meant to control fans given thermal sensor readings.

All sensors in phosphor-dbus-interfaces for OpenBMC use Sensor.Value as their
accessor.  This provides read-only access to information.  The goal of the
configuration is to specify how it can be read and if it's a fan, how the PID
output can be written.  Initially there'll only be sysfs and passive dbus
access.  If a writepath for a sensor is a dbus path, then the system will need
to verify which Control.Fan* interfaces is registered and send values to the
Target property of that interface.

The min/max specified are to range a writePercent to the sensor.  The current
FanController object outputs the new fan speed goal as a PWM percentage.  Other
fan PID control objects may not, and they can leave the fields as 0 & 0.

The only requirement for a sensor is that it isn't writeonly.  Only fans are
expected to have a writepath set, and in this current version non-fan sensors
are assumed readonly. 

The sensor names are unique across all zones.

# PID Config

The PID configuration is a list of PIDs per zone.

[1] readPath has multiple options:
* If it has "/xyz/openbmc_project/extsensors/" in it, it's an EXTERNAL or
  host-provided sensor.
* If it has "/xyz/openbmc_project/" in it, it's a sensor whose value is
  received passively over dbus.
* If it has "/sys/" in it, it's a sensor read directly from sysfs.

[2]
* This can be left blank if the sensor is read-only.
* If it has "/sys/" in it, it's a sensor written to sysfs.
  * If min and max are non-zero, it'll convert the value to within the range.
    and output that modified value.  So, if it receives a value of .90 and min
    is 0, and max is 255, it'll convert that to a value of 229.5 that is then
    cast to int64_t.

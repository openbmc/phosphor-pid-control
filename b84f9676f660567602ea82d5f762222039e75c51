      "message": "Good idea. The handler will still be called if the timer is cancelled, though, as Boost is not very good or reliable about timer cancelling. Maybe set a global flag or something, so that the timer routine knows to do nothing and just exit, if Boost calls it when we are trying to cancel it instead.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/43168199/cancelling-boost-asio-deadline-timer-safely",

But it would be rare. Do you still want to see using a global flag in this patch?",

      "message": "Yes please. In general, use of `cancel()` is a code smell. Boost has never been really reliable about the behaviour of a cancelled timer. Sometimes it will be called immediately, sometimes it will be called later, sometimes it won\u0027t be called at all.\n\nIt\u0027s often just better and safer to have a global flag `isCancelling` or something like that, then your timer handler can know to simply do nothing when it is called. It\u0027s similar to the `weak_ptr` trick used to protect timer handlers from trying to use objects that were deleted before the timer handler was called.",

It makes sense to have this option be a compile-time option, because it needs to exist outside of every thermal zone, and it needs to be part of the program even if there is a JSON parsing failure.\n\nHowever, this only covers the case of a clean shutdown. Users will still need to protect their systems by using systemd service files, because if `phosphor-pid-control` crashes out prematurely, the destructor will not have a chance to run.",

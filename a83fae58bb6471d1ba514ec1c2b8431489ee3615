Since the move to Meson, CLion has became useless, I don\u0027t use it anymore (it was great during the days of CMakeLists, though).\n\nHow about this: OK to clean up .gitignore for now, but if there are temporary filenames that keep coming back into existence, re-add them to this file.",

I\u0027d be curious what they are because generally that means to me we\u0027ve got a mistake where something isn\u0027t working in the out-of-tree build directory directed by Meson.\n\nWe\u0027ve kind of suggested people add their own editor config / swap files to their own global gitignore.",

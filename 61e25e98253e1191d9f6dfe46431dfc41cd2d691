      "message": "You still have these ugly dynamic_pointer_casts, which might not even be the real type of the Zone.  The Zone is written as an abstract class but you\u0027re casting to a specialization.  Please don\u0027t do this.\n\nI would suggest we rewrite this such that the Zones are always aware of a \"manual-mode-manager\".  On construction, they should get their manual-mode from the manager.  On set to the manual-mode property, they should update the manager.\n\nThis would get rid of the dynamic cast and the frail state management going on here.",

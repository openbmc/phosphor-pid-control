It turns out the \"timeout \u003d 0\" and \"ignoreDbusMinMax \u003d true\" settings were already made by other patches since this was originally written, as the same bugs they fix were noticed by others. All that remained to be done was having it apply to all non-fan PID classes, not just \"temp\".\n",

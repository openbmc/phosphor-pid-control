Reason is, NAN is used as an indication of an error, a missing sensor reading, or similar.\n\nThis also reminds me of a historical bug here. We should be using std::isfinite() instead of isnan() here, because that will give us the advantage of being able to also catch other weird floating-point error states like +INF and -INF.",

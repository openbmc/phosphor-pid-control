      "message": "I recommend against it. It attempts to work around a fundamental design problem of dbus-sensors that has been discussed before: https://gerrit.openbmc.org/c/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/+/37357/2#message-6ed61f395d08ba174dfc42cfc5776f3bb6209a3f\n\nProblem is: D-Bus is expensive to send out notifications with, for various reasons. So, fans/sensors don\u0027t send out notifications unless the value changes. For a stable sensor/fan this is a problem, as there\u0027s no way to distinguish \"This bad device has a bug and has frozen up\" versus \"This good device is working great and has been producing a steady unchanging value for a while now\".\n\nThis change is the wrong solution, because it creates a lot of needless D-Bus traffic, which will slow down the rest of the system.\n\nI had a discussion a while ago that resulted in this design document, but it never got traction: go/the-three-es",

      "message": "Well, it\u0027s not really needless traffic as it\u0027s communicating the freshness of a sensor read. I guarantee if we profiled our systems, most sensors in the system will be unstable enough that you will end up sending signals for most updates anyway. So our application that depends on this patch will actually work fine most of the time, but we do have some sensors that are especially stable that need to guarantee reporting.\n\nAlso, it\u0027s the host sensor, it already required at least 2 Dbus calls to get updated in the first place. This isn\u0027t really an explosion of traffic.",

      "message": "This is a good idea. However, I have some questions about the implementation, and about the change to the meaning of the `MissingIsAcceptable` flag.\n\nI like your explanations in the comments. This is good logic. However, it makes a behavioral change to the `MissingIsAcceptable` flag that extends it far beyond its original purpose, and may cause side effects with people trying to use it. We might want to have some discussion about this. Have you mentioned it on the Discord yet?\n\nPlease take a look at the feature request, which your contribution directly helps out with:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/issues/33",

      "message": "Thank you for your review.\n\n\u003e Have you mentioned it on the Discord yet?\n\nI have asked on Discord #general channel about why in case of a sensor missing from DBus, DBus parsing method continues with the remaining sensors, while JSON parsing method fails and rescans. But I received only one answer that suggests pushing a patch myself to request a change.\n\n\u003e https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/issues/33\n\nI found this issue you raised while trying to figure out what to do. That\u0027s why I involved you in. Because in our system, we have some important sensors that if missing, fans need to react and we want to use D-Bus config instead of JSON. phosphor-fan has phosphor-fan-control service to monitor events and set speed accordingly but it does not sync with phosphor-pid-control.\n\nThis patch of mine tries to align to the expectation in the issue because they make sense to me, too. However, the scope of the issue is big, not to mention that we just moved to phosphor-pid-control from phosphor-fan, and we don\u0027t use PID algorithm but just Stepwise, I don\u0027t have much of the knowledge to come up with something that can cover all the aspects. But I think `MissingIsAcceptable` should be what its name describes, in which `missing` also means when the sensor is not on D-Bus. Therefore, I pushed this patch to first address the problem that I\u0027m facing. I\u0027m OK that we can bring this patch to Discord again to ask for more comments.\n\nOne issue I see is that. When a sensor is purposedly built as failed because it\u0027s missing from D-Bus and it\u0027s not in the `MissingIsAcceptable` list. If the controller is configured with `InputUnavailableAsFailed`\u003dfalse, the failed state will be bypassed. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s a high priority to return false right here https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/blob/951aff4cd1ba07f6d25400b7ac87621e76267eab/dbus/dbuspassive.cpp#L158. Should it be reconsidered?",

      "message": "This is a good idea. However, I have some questions about the implementation, and about the change to the meaning of the `MissingIsAcceptable` flag.\n\nI like your explanations in the comments. This is good logic. However, it makes a behavioral change to the `MissingIsAcceptable` flag that extends it far beyond its original purpose, and may cause side effects with people trying to use it. We might want to have some discussion about this. Have you mentioned it on the Discord yet?\n\nPlease take a look at the feature request, which your contribution directly helps out with:\n\nhttps://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-pid-control/issues/33",

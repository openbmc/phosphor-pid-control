Using 20 here would limit the output rate to be no larger than 100 for most platforms as the number of zones are usually \u003c\u003d3.\n\nAccording to Nan, this feature should be normally enabled, since checking out the detailed reason regarding failsafe mode (dis-)enabling would be quite troublesome for the otherwise, which is also quite commonly happening.",

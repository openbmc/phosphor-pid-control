      "message": "We would have to wrap in `std::string()` or something, otherwise we get invalid operands between `const char*` and `const char[N]`, right?\n\nThen we have a bunch of wrapping and it does not look nice.\n\nCurrently it will not win an award due to the reversed order of things.\n\nWhat do you think about a generated helper function that knows the namespace path value and simply takes parameters for the segment and leaf of the object path.\n\nThe leaf could have further path segments, the function would not care.\n\nThat would preserve the order of path segments passed into it and avoid having to `std::format` or concatenate things.",

      "message": "\u003e The sdbusplus path object already supports / just like the std::fs objects do. I\u0027d rather use that for building paths.\n\nThat\u0027s the root of the issue. The path is not a path in the generated header. It\u0027s a `const char*`.\n\n```\n      struct namespace_path\n      {   \n          static constexpr auto value \u003d \"/xyz/openbmc_project/sensors\";\n          static constexpr auto airflow \u003d \"airflow\";\n```\n\nTo do anything with it we must first wrap in a constructor for `sdbusplus::message::object_path`.\n\nBut that one wraps `std::string` which has `constexpr` constructor but has to be destructed at end of constexpr evaluation.\n\nSo we can use it in `constexpr` contexts but we cannot produce any `constexpr` variable with it.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n   // does not compile with C++23\n   constexpr std::string s(\"hello\");\n\n   // compiles!\n   constexpr size_t n \u003d std::string(\"hello\").size();\n```\n\nSo from my perspective `sdbusplus::message::object_path` is not usable for our constexpr object path needs.\n\nWe may need another type for the object path which could be based on `std::array`.\n\nAt the same time we can solve the default-construction issue that `sdbusplus::message::object_path` has (it default-constructs to empty string instead of `/`)",

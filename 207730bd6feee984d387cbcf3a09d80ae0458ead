      "message": "We would have to wrap in `std::string()` or something, otherwise we get invalid operands between `const char*` and `const char[N]`, right?\n\nThen we have a bunch of wrapping and it does not look nice.\n\nCurrently it will not win an award due to the reversed order of things.\n\nWhat do you think about a generated helper function that knows the namespace path value and simply takes parameters for the segment and leaf of the object path.\n\nThe leaf could have further path segments, the function would not care.\n\nThat would preserve the order of path segments passed into it and avoid having to `std::format` or concatenate things.",

      "message": "The sdbusplus path object already supports `/` just like the std::fs objects do.  I\u0027d rather use that for building paths.\n\nIt\u0027s awkward that many of the sdbusplus functions take a std::string instead of an sdbusplus::object_path, but ... that\u0027s because they were written first and we never refactored.",
